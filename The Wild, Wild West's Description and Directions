Hello, and thank you for your interest in playing The Wild, Wild West.

The game is a text-based game which includes the player navigating through three levels of common games that are played by many people around the globe.

The three levels include:
    -Blackjack
    -TicTacToe
    -A coin toss
    
The game is deliberately very difficult to win. That was done to ensure frustration for the player and keep them hooked on the game.


DIRECTIONS:
The directions are very self explanatory, and any instructions you really need should be provided on screen by the game.

Basically, just follow the plotline and take on and succeed at the challenges of Jumpin' Joe, Rockin' Ricky, and Big Bill! Bonus points if you add a fun, alliterative adjective when you select your name in game, as well.

The only extra thing you really need to know is: when you lose, you MUST hit refresh on your computer or find another way to restart the game. When it (spoiler) prints "loser" infinitely many times, there is no escape. You lost. Loser. So restart the game and play again, because I know you'll want to. Beat my game, and if you actually cared enough to read these instructions and provide photographic evidence of the victory text, I will personally deliver you a twizzler.

                                                                                                    -MK
